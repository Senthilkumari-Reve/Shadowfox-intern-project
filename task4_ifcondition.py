#1.BMI Category Calculator
#Ask the user for:Height(in meters),Weight(in kilograms)
#BMI = weight/(height**2)

#Then print the correct BMI category:

    #BMI â‰¥ 30 = Obesity

    #BMI 25 to <30 = Overweight

    #BMI 18.5 to <25 = Normal

    #BMI < 18.5 = Underweight

# Get user input
height = float(input("Enter height in meters: "))
weight = float(input("Enter weight in kilograms: "))

# Calculate BMI
bmi = weight / (height ** 2)

# Determine category
if bmi >= 30:
