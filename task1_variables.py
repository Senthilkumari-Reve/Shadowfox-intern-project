#1.Created a Variable named pi and store the value 22/7in it.and checked the Data type of this Variable
pi = 22 / 7
print("Value of pi:", pi)
print("Data type of pi:", type(pi))

#2.creating for as variable and assigned the value 4
# for = 4  ‚ùå This will cause a SyntaxError because 'for' is a reserved keyword in Python.
# Instead:
for_value = 4
print("Value stored in for_value:", for_value)

#3.Store the principal amount ,rate of intrest and time in years in different variaables
P = 10000  # Principal amount
R = 5      # Rate of interest
T = 3      # Time in years

#calculation of simple intrest for 3years
# Simple Interest Formula
SI = (P * R * T) / 100
print("Simple Interest for 3 years:", SI)
